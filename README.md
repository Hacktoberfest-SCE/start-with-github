A Pull Request, or PR, is a way to contribute to a repository in GitHub.

A Pull Request allows us to contribute code to our own repo, our teams repo, or an open source repo.

The repository needs to be open, or you need to have permission to be able to submit a PR. If you have permission, then go ahead and follow the upcoming steps! If you do not, simply "Fork and Clone" the repository. Once you Fork it, then it will live on your own GitHub account as a forked repo.

Why Make a Pull Request?
Pull Requests are a big deal in the world of collaborative coding. If you've ever heard the term open source, then you may be familiar with this concept of having anyone see your code and make suggestions to it.

You could even contribute to some of the code changes and even issues on favorite projects like React. We can see the pull requests that others have done to help make React a better library.

An example of why you would want to make a Pull Request is you are working on a team and you contribute to the repository. Creating a PR is important because we wouldn't want to push to the master branch until code reviews are completed and a teammate approves it.

Let's talk about the steps to create a pull request on a project. We'll be walking through the steps to grab a project and make a pull request.

Cloning into a Project
There are two ways to start the process.

Cloning anotherâ€™s project
Your own project you started from scratch (not very likely)

Fork the Repository
You can fork a repository on GitHub by navigating with your browser to the GitHub URL of the open-source project you would like to contribute to.
